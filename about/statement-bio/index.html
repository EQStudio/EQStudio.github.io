  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>I always try to understand our existence—this life and our relationship to one another. My lifelong curiosity, which led me to journalism, now fuels my passion for art. Both disciplines, for me, are exploratory lenses that allow me to look more deeply into what lies beneath the surface of things. The tension between the seen and unseen is the common thread running through my work. I seek to give an image to the unnamable and a voice to the unspeakable. Initially a writer, I value the ancient power of storytelling. Viewing myself as both a chronicler and a participant of our time, I work to preserve a fragment of a larger narrative while providing a unique perspective on the complexity of our human experience. My work focuses on time, memory, and identity while searching to understand not only who we have been but who we can be.</p>
