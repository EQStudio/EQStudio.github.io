Combining printmaking and painting, hovering between abstraction and representation, "Every Place Weâ€™ve Been" documents the disorienting experiences of the last years on both a collective and personal level. The translucent paper is painted on both sides, symbolizing two realms: the collective consciousness on one side and the personal on the other. Each side informs and transforms the other. When viewed from different perspectives, new images emerge.

Using images culled from news, various archival sources, as well as personal snapshots, the installation examines the impacts of news and journalism, explores how history becomes a collective embodied memory, and draws attention to the boundaries between the personal and the public.
